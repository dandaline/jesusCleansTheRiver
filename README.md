We made this together for a software techniques class at HTWK Leipzig.

In order to run the game you need to install pygame:
```$ pip install pygame```
If this gives you errors regarding external managed environments, create a virtual environment in the cloned repo:
```$ virtualenv <name>``` <br>
```$ <name>/bin/activate``` <br>
```$ pip install pygame``` <br>
Now you can run the game using:
```$ python3 Main.py```
